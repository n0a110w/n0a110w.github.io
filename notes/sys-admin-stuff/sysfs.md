### Sysfs
Sysfs is a virtual file system mounted at `/sys` used to facilitate information exchange between the kernel and user space. ("virtual" meaning that no real files exist on any storage devices)
- kernel objects are directories
- object attributes are simple files
- object relationships are symbolic links
