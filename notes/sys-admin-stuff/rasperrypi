## How to write Raspbian image to SD card using dd
- If image is zipped, it is possible to unzip the image and pipe it thru dd as so:
```bash
unzip -p 2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.zip | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M conv=fsync
```
- Otherwise, just use dd to copy the image directly:
```bash
unzip -p 2018-11-13-raspbian-stretch.zip | dd of=/dev/sdX bs=4M conv=fsync
```

- you can check the status by sending the USR1 signal to the dd PID: `kill -USR1 $PID`
- OR some newer versions of dd allow the argument `status=progress` to be passed when dd is ran

Finally, run Sync to flush the write cache: `sync`

### Enable SSH by default on boot:
- Create a file with the name 'ssh' in the root of the boot partition
```bash
mount /dev/sdc /media/sdc
touch /media/sdc/ssh
umount /dev/sdc
```
